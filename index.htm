			<dt>0.9.4</dt><dd>New features and a few bug fixes:
				<ul>
					<li>
						New plugin - <a href="http://fawx.com/ljArchive/rid.htm">Regressive Imagery Analysis</a>.
						This plugin provides a psychological profile of your journal by performing a <i>categorical
						content analysis</i>, and provides the results as a Summary graph, a graph Over Time,
						or a summary as HTML Code that you can paste in your journal.</li>
					<li>
						New plugin - <a href="http://fawx.com/ljArchive/entryreader.htm">Entry Reader</a>,
						reads your journal entries aloud using text-to-speech technology.</li>
					<li>
						Auto-update - ljArchive can now alert the user when a new version is available, and
						update itself automatically.</li>
					<li>
						Smaller install size - dropped some propietary HTML libraries, allowing the install
						size to shrink from ~9M to ~1.3M.</li>
					<li>
						Minor UI improvements.  Most notably, clicking on a comment will now scroll the browser
						page so the comment comes into view.</li>
					<li>
						French language support (courtesy of Frederic Barthelemy).</li>
				</ul>
				</dd>
			<dt>0.9.3</dt><dd>Restructured and rewrote parts of the ljArchive core classes:
				<ul>
					<li>
						New <a href="http://fawx.com/ljArchive/doc/">core class library</a> is 
						completely OS-agnostic and should support any ECMA-compatible runtime engine 
						with .NET core libraries (such as <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">mono</a>).</li>
					<li>
						Cleaned up code and created <a href="http://fawx.com/ljArchive/doc/">documentation</a>
						for the new core library.</li>
					<li>
						Implemented new functionality in the HTML journal renderer. Now supports lots 
						of colors, and a more thorough template system. Tuned performance (33% speed 
						gain).</li>
				</ul>
				Lots of UI improvements:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Completely rewrote the main explorer window to support multiple resizable panes.</li>
					<li>
						Implemented informative error messages for commonly expected errors.</li>
					<li>
						Implemented localization support. The only language currently is English :-)</li>
					<li>
						Added a couple more templates and documented them so users can make their own.</li>
				</ul>
				And lots of bug fixes. Fixed bugs related to users not being able to connect 
				with free accounts and not being able to connect to alternate servers. Tested 
				with <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a>, <a href="http://www.deadjournal.com/">
					DeadJournal</a>, and <a href="http://www.ujournal.org/">UJournal</a>.
