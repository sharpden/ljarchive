                        Fixed ljArchive Core to build in Mono.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed some internationalization issues regarding how ljArchive stores dates and numbers.

                    <li>

            <dt>0.9.6 (2006-02-19) Deb Hooker</dt>
            <dd>XMLRPC bugfixes and LJ cookie changes.
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the new LJ session cookies (we still set the old one as well, in case we're communicating with a site that uses old-style cookies).</li>
                    <li>Some low-level changes to the XMLRPC protocol to match what LJ is now doing.  Hopefully this'll stop all the XmlRpc errors.</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>

            <dt>0.9.5 (2005-07-27) Deb Hooker</dt>
            <dd>Initial tags support, move to sourceforge, and minor bugfixes.
                <ul>
                    <li>Basic support for tags.  (Nothing fancy, but at least we download them and display them now.)</li>
                    <li>Update various URLs and informational strings to point to the
                        sourceforge homepage instead of to fawx.com for now.
                        (The sourceforge page will maintain a link to fawx.com, of course,
                        but as we update things we'd rather have people come to the up-to-date site
                        first.) Also update the online-update-check links to something we can
                        actually update as we release new releases.</li>
                    <li>ljArchive.build:  Add a really basic NAnt build file to build the various
                        release file packages.  Has hardcoded pathnames to executables in it, so it
                        needs work, but it's a start.</li>
                    <li>WindowsForms/Explorer.cs:  Handle FormatException and InvalidCastException
                        when trying to get the last update-check date.  (Fixes bug 1235116.)</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>

            <dt>0.9.4.3</dt>
            <dd>New feature and minor fix:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Can now partially sync.  This is useful when the Livejournal server is bogged down and dies
                        halfway through a big sync.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Changed request header to disable Keep-alive.  This was causing LiveJournal to return
                        bad HTTP responses.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </dd>

            <dt>0.9.4.2</dt>
            <dd>Bug-fixes and two new features:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Added new calendar panel.  Allows user to navigate through months, and view entries by day.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added new template: unearthed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed error in XMLRPC trying to cast values improperly reported as integer by the server.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed "Go To Day Entry" formatting improperly on non-English computers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed wrong ExpectedSyncException ocassionally being reported.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed error window popping up sometimes in background.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed "anonymous" user not being rendered properly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed HTML color settings not being saved properly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed File->New Dialog occasionally defaulting to invalid path.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed CommentCount sometimes throwing exception when initialized.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed ToolTip not always showing properly on CommentCount.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed protected icon not showing in Component template.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed grid sort: now defaults to date descending.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed find results not clearing when panel was hidden.
                    </li>
                </ul>            
            </dd>

            <dt>0.9.4.1</dt>
            <dd>Bug-fixes and a few small feature updates:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Fixed plugins crashing if the journal archive was empty.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tweaked Regressive Imagery Analysis behavior for potentially bad analyses, such
                        as running the analysis on a non-English journal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed extra line-breaks occurring in RID HTML output.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed plugins and journalwriters settings serializing in an assembly-version-dependant
                        manner.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed plugin collection crashing if a target invocation exception occurred while loading a
                        plugin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added 'Split File Per Entry' setting in File->Export.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </dd>

            <dt>0.9.4</dt>
            <dd>New features and a few bug fixes:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        New plugin - <a href="http://fawx.com/ljArchive/rid.htm">Regressive Imagery Analysis</a>.
                        This plugin provides a psychological profile of your journal by performing a <i>categorical
                        content analysis</i>, and provides the results as a Summary graph, a graph Over Time,
                        or a summary as HTML Code that you can paste in your journal.</li>
                    <li>
                        New plugin - <a href="http://fawx.com/ljArchive/entryreader.htm">Entry Reader</a>,
                        reads your journal entries aloud using text-to-speech technology.</li>
                    <li>
                        Auto-update - ljArchive can now alert the user when a new version is available, and
                        update itself automatically.</li>
                    <li>
                        Smaller install size - dropped some propietary HTML libraries, allowing the install
                        size to shrink from ~9M to ~1.3M.</li>
                    <li>
                        Minor UI improvements.  Most notably, clicking on a comment will now scroll the browser
                        page so the comment comes into view.</li>
                    <li>
                        French language support (courtesy of Frederic Barthelemy).</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>

            <dt>0.9.3</dt>
            <dd>Restructured and rewrote parts of the ljArchive core classes:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        New <a href="http://fawx.com/ljArchive/doc/">core class library</a> is 
                        completely OS-agnostic and should support any ECMA-compatible runtime engine 
                        with .NET core libraries (such as <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">mono</a>).</li>
                    <li>
                        Cleaned up code and created <a href="http://fawx.com/ljArchive/doc/">documentation</a>
                        for the new core library.</li>
                    <li>
                        Implemented new functionality in the HTML journal renderer. Now supports lots 
                        of colors, and a more thorough template system. Tuned performance (33% speed 
                        gain).</li>
                </ul>
                Lots of UI improvements:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Completely rewrote the main explorer window to support multiple resizable panes.</li>
                    <li>
                        Implemented informative error messages for commonly expected errors.</li>
                    <li>
                        Implemented localization support. The only language currently is English :-)</li>
                    <li>
                        Added a couple more templates and documented them so users can make their own.</li>
                </ul>
                And lots of bug fixes. Fixed bugs related to users not being able to connect 
                with free accounts and not being able to connect to alternate servers. Tested 
                with <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a>, <a href="http://www.deadjournal.com/">
                    DeadJournal</a>, and <a href="http://www.ujournal.org/">UJournal</a>.
            </dd>

            <dt>0.9.2</dt>
            <dd>Added support for downloading/browsing/searching comments.<br />
                Updated loading/saving code - new file format is about 35% smaller and loads 
                approximately <b>6x</b> faster than the old format.<br />
                Updated the common IPlugin/IEventWriter interfaces to allow Plugins and 
                EventWriters to support the new comment functionality.<br />
                Updated the template rendering structure of HTMLEventWriter to support 
                comments.<br />

            </dd>

            <dt>0.9.1</dt>
            <dd>Coalesced business and network code into a single business 
                library. (Paving the way for a Mono version - only needs to implement UI)<br />
                Added setup project, application icon.<br />
                Fixed problem where links clicked in the internal browser opened internally.<br />
                Fixed problem where ljArchive croaked if it got back a type it didn't expect 
                from the server.<br />
                Added more user-friendly error reporting.<br />
