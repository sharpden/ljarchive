* Bump version numbers for 0.9.6.

* Use the new LJ session cookies (we still set the old one as well,
  in case we're communicating with a site that uses old-style cookies).

* Some low-level changes to the XMLRPC protocol to match what LJ is
  now doing.  Hopefully this'll stop all the XmlRpc errors.

2005-07-27  Deb Hooker <deb@users.sourceforge.net>

* Bump version numbers as appropriate for a 0.9.5 release.

* Basic support for tags.  (Nothing fancy, but at least we download
  them and display them now.)

* Update various URLs and informational strings to point to the
  sourceforge homepage instead of to fawx.com for now.
  (The sourceforge page will maintain a link to fawx.com, of course,
  but as we update things we'd rather have people come to the up-to-date site
  first.) Also update the online-update-check links to something we can
  actually update as we release new releases.

* ljArchive.build:  Add a really basic NAnt build file to build the various
  release file packages.  Has hardcoded pathnames to executables in it, so it
  needs work, but it's a start.

* WindowsForms/Explorer.cs:  Handle FormatException and InvalidCastException
  when trying to get the last update-check date.  (Fixes bug 1235116.)
